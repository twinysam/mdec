# MS-DOS Edit Clone: MDEC
***(C) 2016 David Cramer***


## Description
**MDEC**
(Pronounced ehm * dehk)
This is a clone of the old MS-DOS editor "Edit".
Seems like clones of this are hard to come by, so I decided I'd try my hand at it.

## Versioning

MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD :: 0.0.0

For versioning I've taken the MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format. In the begining this is going to be pretty flexible on the BUILD bit. until 1.0.0 I probably wont even use the BUILD part of this versioning. After however, I'll use it for patches and the MINOR will be used for feature improvments and adding. MAJOR is pretty self-explanitory, I'll increment as I feel there is a large enough seperation from the previous MAJOR to validate a version change.
